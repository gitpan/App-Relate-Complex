App-Relate-version 0.04
=======================

Implements the functionality for the L<relate_complex> script,
which uses the system's "locate" database to find file names that
match multiple search terms.

This version uses the List::Filter modules to get some
flexibility and persistance advantages.

It tries to access the locate database through File::Locate::Harder
in order to be relatively portable.

Note, this code base was originally released as App::Relate (up to
version 0.03) when it was renamed with the tag "complex" to distinguish
it from a newer, simpler design.
