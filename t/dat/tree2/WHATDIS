This is another tree of files to be indexed locally by slocate 
over here: 

~/End/Cave/Relate/Wall/List-Filter/lib/List/Filter/App/t/dat/slocate2

My intention is to make tree2 indefinitely extensible, by making some 
informal notes about what the existing tests expect to see there, 
so that later extensions won't impact already existing tests. 

For test #7 (all numbers approximate):

    my $test_name = "Testing relate method using the :skipdull filter";

*.txt files with "doom" or "shadow" in the title, plus backups and autosaves, 
and RCS version control.
